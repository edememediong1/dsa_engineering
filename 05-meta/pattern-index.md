# Pattern Quick Reference

## Two Pointers
**When to use:** Sorted arrays, finding pairs, palindromes
**Key signals:** "sorted array", "find pair", "in-place"

## Sliding Window
**When to use:** Subarrays, substrings, contiguous sequences
**Key signals:** "maximum/minimum subarray", "substring with", "contiguous"

## Binary Search
**When to use:** Sorted data, search space reduction
**Key signals:** "sorted", "find minimum/maximum that satisfies", "O(log n)"

## Hash Map
**When to use:** Frequency counting, quick lookups, duplicates
**Key signals:** "find duplicate", "count", "two sum variant"

## BFS/DFS
**When to use:** Graph traversal, tree problems, connected components
**Key signals:** "shortest path", "level order", "connected"

## Dynamic Programming
**When to use:** Optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems
**Key signals:** "maximum/minimum", "count ways", "can you reach"

## Backtracking
**When to use:** Generate all possibilities, combinations, permutations
**Key signals:** "all combinations", "all permutations", "generate all"

## Greedy
**When to use:** Local optimal leads to global optimal
**Key signals:** "minimum number of", "maximum number of", interval problems
